            <p class="alber">Albert Camus (1913â€“1960) was a French-Algerian philosopher, writer, and journalist, known for his contributions to existentialism and absurdism. Born in Mondovi, Algeria, he grew up in poverty but excelled academically. His most famous works, *The Stranger*, *The Plague*, and *The Myth of Sisyphus*, explore the absurdity of human existence. Camus won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957 for his profound influence on modern thought. He was also a strong advocate for justice and opposed totalitarianism. His philosophy emphasized rebellion and individual freedom in an indifferent universe. Tragically, he died in a car accident in 1960 at the age of 46.</p>

            <p class="Jean-Paul">Jean-Paul Sartre (1905â€“1980) was a French philosopher, playwright, novelist, and political activist, best known as a leading figure in existentialism. Born in Paris, he studied at the Ã‰cole Normale SupÃ©rieure and later became a professor. His major works, including *Being and Nothingness* and *No Exit*, explore themes of freedom, responsibility, and existential angst. Sartre rejected traditional morality, emphasizing that humans define their own meaning in a meaningless world. In 1964, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature but declined it, stating that writers should not be institutionalized. He was also politically active, supporting Marxist and revolutionary movements. Sartreâ€™s ideas continue to influence philosophy, literature, and political thought worldwide.</p>
